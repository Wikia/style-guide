<h4>Welcome</h4>
<p>
	This is Wikia's first draft of a style guide and represents a work-in-progress, with the goal of changing in smaller increments over time, as styles are tested with real world use cases.
</p>
<p>
	The document is primarily aimed at international designers and developers at this time in order to drive greater consistency across design and front-end development, but it is available to anyone interested.
